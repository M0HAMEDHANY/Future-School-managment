I designed this with my friends as a college project for practical exams in the second semester of the second year in the faculty of computers and informatics at Suez Canal University
we done this project with eclipse as IDE for our project , we build this progect from scratch within one day so it was a very very challenge cause we dont have any time for all of this and we got the full mark in our practical exam.


Technical Implementation:

JavaFX and Scene Builder: This powerful duo allows you to design a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for the desktop application. Scene Builder streamlines the process of creating a visually appealing and intuitive interface for managing school data.
XAMPP: This open-source package provides a local server environment, allowing you to set up a MySQL database using XAMPP's built-in tools. This database will be the heart of your application, storing and managing school information.

Building Our Project:

Data Modeling: Design your MySQL database schema to efficiently store all relevant student data
GUI Design: Use Scene Builder to create user interfaces for data entry, viewing, and editing. Ensure a clear and organized layout for easy navigation.
JavaFX Application Logic: Write Java code to connect to the MySQL database using JDBC libraries. This code will handle tasks like fetching data, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and manipulating data within the application.
